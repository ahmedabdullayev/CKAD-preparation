## Question

There is an existing Deployment named api-new-c32 in Namespace neptune.
A developer did make an update to the Deployment but the updated version never came online.
Check the Deployment history and find a revision that works, then rollback to it.
Could you tell Team Neptune what the error was so it doesn't happen again?

## Env setup

1. kubectl create ns neptune

2. create working deployment and then set image to broken one

    kubectl create deployment api-new-c32 \
    --image=nginx:1.21 \
    -n neptune

    kubectl set image deployment/api-new-c32 \
    nginx=nginx:nonexistent \
    -n neptune

3. check pods

    kubectl get pods -n neptune

    // will show failing pods

## Solution

1. Check rollout history

    kubectl rollout history deployment/api-new-c32 -n neptune

2. rollback to working revision

    kubectl rollout undo deployment/api-new-c32 --to-revision=1 -n neptune
