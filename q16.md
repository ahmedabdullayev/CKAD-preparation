## Question 16

The Tech Lead of Mercury2D decided it's time for more logging, to finally fight all these missing data incidents. There is an existing
container named cleaner-con in Deployment cleaner in Namespace mercury. This container mounts a volume and writes logs into a file called cleaner.log.
The yaml for the existing Deployment is available at /opt/course/16/cleaner.yaml. Persist your changes at /opt/course/16/cleaner-new.yaml on ckad7326 but also make sure
the Deployment is running.
Create a sidecar container named logger-con, image
busybox: 1.31.0, which mounts the same volume and writes the content of cleaner. log to stdout, you can use the tail -f command for this. This way it can be picked up by kubectl logs.
Check if the logs of the new container reveal something about the missing data incidents.

## Env setup

```
k create ns mercury
```

create cleaner.yaml with this content:
```
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: cleaner
  namespace: mercury
spec:
  replicas: 2
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      id: cleaner
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        id: cleaner
    spec:
      volumes:
        - name: logs
          emptyDir: {}
      initContainers:
        - name: init
          image: bash:5.0.11
          command: ['bash', '-c', 'echo init > /var/log/cleaner/cleaner.log']
          volumeMounts:
            - name: logs
              mountPath: /var/log/cleaner
      containers:
        - name: cleaner-con
          image: bash:5.0.11
          args: ['bash', '-c', 'while true; do echo `date`: "remove random file" >> /var/log/cleaner/cleaner.log; sleep 1; done']
          volumeMounts:
            - name: logs
              mountPath: /var/log/cleaner

```

## Solution

1. copy to new file
```
cp cleaner.yaml cleaner-new.yaml
```

2. add side container that tracks logs

add this at the end of cleaner-new.yaml under containers:

```
- name: logger-con
  image: busybox:1.31.0
  args: ['sh', '-c', 'tail -f /var/log/cleaner/cleaner.log']
  volumeMounts:
    - name: logs
      mountPath: /var/log/cleaner
```

should be like this:

```
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: cleaner
  namespace: mercury
spec:
  replicas: 2
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      id: cleaner
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        id: cleaner
    spec:
      volumes:
        - name: logs
          emptyDir: {}
      initContainers:
        - name: init
          image: bash:5.0.11
          command: ['bash', '-c', 'echo init > /var/log/cleaner/cleaner.log']
          volumeMounts:
            - name: logs
              mountPath: /var/log/cleaner
      containers:
        - name: cleaner-con
          image: bash:5.0.11
          args: ['bash', '-c', 'while true; do echo `date`: "remove random file" >> /var/log/cleaner/cleaner.log; sleep 1; done']
          volumeMounts:
            - name: logs
              mountPath: /var/log/cleaner
        - name: logger-con
          image: busybox:1.31.0
          args: ['sh', '-c', 'tail -f /var/log/cleaner/cleaner.log']
          volumeMounts:
            - name: logs
              mountPath: /var/log/cleaner
```

4. apply new deployment

```
k apply -f cleaner-new.yaml
```

5. check logs

```
k logs <pod> -n mercury -c logger-con
```

will return logs
