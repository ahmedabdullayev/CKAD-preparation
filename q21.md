## Question 21

Team Neptune needs 3 Pods of image httpd:2.4-alpine, create a Deployment named neptune-10ab for this. The containers should be named neptune-pod-10ab. Each container should have a memory request of 20Mi and a memory limit of 50Mi.
Team Neptune has it's own ServiceAccount neptune-sa-v2 under which the Pods should run. The Deployment should be in Namespace neptune.

## Env setup

1. create namespace neptune

2. create serviceaccount

```
k create serviceaccount -n neptune neptune-sa-v2
```

## Solution

1. create deployment

```
k create -n neptune deployment neptune-10ab --image=httpd:alpine --replicas=3 -o yaml --dry-run=client > deployment.yaml
```

2. add memory requests, limits:
```
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  labels:
    app: neptune-10ab
  name: neptune-10ab
  namespace: neptune
spec:
  replicas: 3
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: neptune-10ab
  strategy: {}
  template:
    metadata:
      creationTimestamp: null
      labels:
        app: neptune-10ab
    spec:
      serviceAccountName: neptune-sa-v2
      containers:
      - image: httpd:alpine
        name: httpd
        resources:
          limits:
            memory: "50Mi"
          requests:
            memory: "20Mi"
```
