# Question

Team Mercury asked you to perform some operations using Helm, all in Namespace mercury:

Delete release internal-issue-report-apiv1

Upgrade release internal-issue-report-apiv2 to any newer version of chart bitnami/nginx available

Install a new release internal-issue-report-apache of chart bitnami/apache. The Deployment should have two replicas, set these via Helm-values during install

There seems to be a broken release, stuck in pending-install state. Find it and delete it


## Environment setup
1. Add Bitnami Helm repo:

    helm repo add bitnami https://charts.bitnami.com/bitnami

    helm repo update

2. Create the target namespace

    kubectl create namespace mercury

3. Install releases

    helm install internal-issue-report-apiv1 bitnami/nginx -n mercury

    // old version

    helm install internal-issue-report-apiv2 bitnami/nginx --version 15.0.0 -n mercury 

    // broken version, it was easier to create failed release than in "pending-install" status

    helm install broken-release bitnami/nginx -n mercury --timeout 1s --wait

## Solution

1. Delete release

    helm uninstall internal-issue-report-apiv1 -n mercury

2. Upgrade internal-issue-report-apiv2 to latest

    helm repo update

    helm upgrade internal-issue-report-apiv2 bitnami/nginx -n mercury

3.  Find and delete release stuck in "pending-install" - in our case "failed"

    helm list -n mercury -a

    helm uninstall broken-release -n mercury
