## Question 7
The board of Team Neptune decided to take over control of one e-commerce webserver from Team Saturn. The administrator who once setup this webserver is not part of the organisation any longer. All information you could get was that the e-commerce system is called my-happy-shop.

Search for the correct Pod in Namespace saturn and move it to Namespace neptune. It doesn't matter if you shut it down and spin it up again, it probably hasn't any customers anyways.

## Env setup

1. create namespaces

kubectl create ns saturn
kubectl create ns neptune

2. Simulate the "my-happy-shop" Pod in saturn
kubectl run my-happy-shop \
  --image=nginx \
  --namespace=saturn \
  --labels=app=my-happy-shop \


## Solution

1. create a copy of my-happy-shop pod yaml, two options:

    1.1 kubectl edit pod my-happy-shop -n saturn
    1.2 kubectl get pod my-happy-shop -n saturn -o yaml > pod.yaml

2. replace namespace in the file from saturn to neptune

    namespace: neptune

3. kubectl apply -f pod.yaml

4. k get pods -A
