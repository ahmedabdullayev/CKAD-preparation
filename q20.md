## Question 20

In Namespace venus you'll find two Deployments named api and frontend. Both Deployments are exposed inside the cluster using Services. Create a NetworkPolicy named np1 which restricts outgoing tcp connections from Deployment frontend and only allows those going to Deployment api. Make sure the NetworkPolicy still allows outgoing traffic on UDP/TCP ports 53 for DNS resolution.
Test using: wget www.google.com and wget api:2222 from a Pod of Deployment frontend.

## Env setup

1. create api deployment
```
controlplane:~$ cat api-deployment.yaml 
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: api
  namespace: venus
  labels:
    app: api
spec:
  replicas: 2
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: api
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: api # Important: Pods must have this label for the Service and NetworkPolicy to select them
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: api-container
        image: nginx # Using nginx as a placeholder
        ports:
        - containerPort: 80 # Default nginx port, service will target thi

```

2. create api service

```
controlplane:~$ cat api-service.yaml 
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: api
  namespace: venus
spec:
  selector:
    app: api # This selector should match the labels of the 'api' pods
  ports:
    - protocol: TCP
      port: 2222 # The service port requested in the problem
      targetPort: 80 # The port on the 'api' pods (nginx default)
  type: ClusterIP
```

3. create frontend deployment

```
controlplane:~$ cat frontend-deployment.yaml 
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: frontend
  namespace: venus
  labels:
    app: frontend
spec:
  replicas: 5 # One replica is enough for testing
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: frontend
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: frontend # Important: Pods must have this label for the NetworkPolicy to select them
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: frontend-busybox-container ## NOT NEEDED, JUST EXAMPLE WITH 2 CONTAINERS
        image: busybox # Contains wget
        command: ["/bin/sh", "-c", "sleep 3600"] # Keep the container running
      - name: frontend-nginx-container
        image: nginx:alpine
        ports:
          - containerPort: 80
```

4. create frontend service

```
controlplane:~$ cat frontend-service.yaml 
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: frontend
  namespace: venus
spec:
  selector:
    app: frontend # This selector matches the labels of the 'frontend' pods
  ports:
    - protocol: TCP
      port: 80 # Service port
      targetPort: 80 # Port on the nginx-container in the 'frontend' pod
  type: ClusterIP
```


## Solution

1. create netowrk policy and then test

```
controlplane:~$ cat network-policy.yaml 
apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
kind: NetworkPolicy
metadata:
  name: frontend-network-policy
  namespace: venus
spec:
  podSelector:
    matchLabels:
      app: frontend
  policyTypes:
  - Egress
  egress:
   - to:
     - podSelector:
         matchLabels:
           app: api
   - ports:
     - protocol: TCP
       port: 53
     - protocol: UDP
       port: 53
```

2. test it with frontend service

Should timeout(because of network policy):
```
k exec -n venus <pod-name> -- wget www.google.com
```
Should work:
```
k exec -n venus <pod-name> -- wget api:2222
```
