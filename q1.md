## Question 1
Each question needs to be solved on a specific instance other than your main candidate@terminal. You'll need to connect to the correct instance via ssh and the proper command is provided before every question. To connect to another instance you always need to return first to your main terminal by running the exit command, then you can connect again via ssh to a different one.

In the real exam each question will be solved on a different instance whereas in the simulator multiple questions will be solved on the same instances.

Solve this question on instance: ssh ckad5601

The DevOps team would like to get the list of all Namespaces in the cluster. Get the list and save it to /opt/course/1/namespaces on ckad5601.

## Soluion

```sh
kubectl get namespace > /opt/course/1/namespaces
```
