## Question

Solve this question on instance: ssh ckad9043

During the last monthly meeting you mentioned your strong expertise in container technology. Now the Build&Release team of department Sun is in need of your insight knowledge. There are files to build a container image located at /opt/course/11/image. The container will run a Golang application which outputs information to stdout. You're asked to perform the following tasks:

NOTE: Make sure to run all commands as user candidate, for docker use sudo docker

Change the Dockerfile. The value of the environment variable SUN_CIPHER_ID should be set to the hardcoded value 5b9c1065-e39d-4a43-a04a-e59bcea3e03f.

Build the image using Docker, named registry.killer.sh:5000/sun-cipher, tagged as latest and v1-docker, push these to the registry.

Build the image using Podman, named registry.killer.sh:5000/sun-cipher, tagged as v1-podman, push it to the registry.

Run a container using Podman, which keeps running in the background, named sun-cipher using image registry.killer.sh:5000/sun-cipher:v1-podman. Run the container from candidate@ckad9043 and not root@ckad9043.

Write the logs your container sun-cipher produced into /opt/course/11/logs. Then write a list of all running Podman containers into /opt/course/11/containers on ckad9043.

## Setup env

1. create folder
```
mkdir image
```
2. create Dockerfile

```
cat <<EOF > Dockerfile
FROM golang:1.20-alpine

ENV SUN_CIPHER_ID=PLACEHOLDER

WORKDIR /app

COPY . .

RUN go build -o cipher .

CMD ["./cipher"]
EOF
```
3. create simple go app

```
cat <<EOF > cipher.go
package main

import (
	"fmt"
	"os"
)

func main() {
	fmt.Println("Cipher ID:", os.Getenv("SUN_CIPHER_ID"))
}
EOF
```

4. init go module

```
go mod init cipher
```

5. fix docker registry stuff

```
echo "127.0.0.1 registry.killer.sh" | sudo tee -a /etc/hosts

sudo docker run -d -p 5000:5000 --restart=always --name registry registry:2
```

## Solution

1. Build images

```
sudo docker build -t registry.killer.sh:5000/sun-cipher:latest -t registry.killer.sh:5000/sun-cipher:v1-docker .
```

2. Push image

```
sudo docker push registry.killer.sh:5000/sun-cipher:latest
sudo docker push registry.killer.sh:5000/sun-cipher:v1-docker
```

3. check image

```
sudo docker image ls
```

4. Build images with podman and tag

```
podman build -t registry.killer.sh:5000/sun-cipher:v1-podman .
```

5. Push image to registry

```
podman push registry.killer.sh:5000/sun-cipher:v1-podman
```

6. Create and run container with podman

```
podman run -d --name sun-cipher registry.killer.sh:5000/sun-cipher:v1-podman
```

7. check contaner

```
podman ps
```

8. save logs of podman container sun-chiper

```
podman logs sun-chiper > logs
```

9. Save list of running podman container

```
podman ps > containers
```
